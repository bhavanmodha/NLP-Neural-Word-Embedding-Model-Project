# Neural Word Embedding Model Project

## Overview
This project implements Bengio et al.'s 2003 neural language model using PyTorch. The model learns word embeddings from scratch, enabling various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Implementation:** Constructed a neural network to predict word probabilities based on context, facilitating the generation of word embeddings.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Engineered pipelines for efficient vocabulary extraction, one-hot encoding, and context window creation, enhancing model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Utilized stochastic gradient descent for model training and conducted intrinsic evaluation using the WordSim353 dataset.

### The accompanying Python notebook provides detailed explanations of each step and cell.
